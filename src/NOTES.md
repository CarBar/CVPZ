# Notes

Things that may need to be looked into or remembers for the time being. This is **not** a replacement for the README.md!

## Angular Update Notes

Through the process of updating Angular following the instructions at (https://update.angular.io/) there were a few sites pointed out to go look at. These should be reviewed before we toss this note. I would like to make sure there is no further action needed on them.

- (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-1.html) It asked us to look for breaking changes. This is a template site, so likely not.
- (https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs-tslint) We migrated versions of RXJS and we ran a `rxjs-5-to-6-migrate` command. It stated the prior version was deprecated. This is likely just something we should become familiar with **rxjs** has been awesome thus far, so we should learn the new version.
